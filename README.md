<h2>Actions taken:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keywords

Removed the Keywords meta tag Google does not use anymore
Remove black hat techniques from divs and random tags.</li>

<li>Text alternatives

The website used three images that present written content.
This content was not accessible to people who use screen readers and other such technologies, these images have been removed and replaced with written text.
The text alternatives contained only keywords.
The alternative text must describe the appearance and function of the image,therefore has been replaced.</li>


<li>CSS files

The W3C HTML and CSS validator should not reveal any errors. 
Remove unused CSS.
The CSS files have been minified,to reduce the files sizes therefore improving load speeds.</li>

<li>JavaScript files

The JavaScript files have been minified,to reduce the files sizes therefore improving load speeds.
Removed all unused JavaScript.
Moved the JavaScript tag at the end of the html tag so that the main content will load first and to improve performance.
Updated JavaScript library (Jquery & Bootstrap) to prevent security vulnerabilities</li>

<li>Colour

Content displayed in some areas did not have sufficient contrast ratio.
Colours have been changed accordingly.</li>

<li>Semantic Tags

Codes was sectioned off using mostly div tags, semantic tags have been used instead.</li>

<li>Meta Data

The title and the description tags did not have any content,this content has been added.</li>

<li>Responsiveness

Parts of the website including the navigation of Page2 was not responsive and unclear of where it lead. 
Rectified this issue making navigating the website clearer.</li>

<li>Images

The sizes of the images are too large and they were not compressed .This was rectified without reducing the visual quality of the images converting them in webp format.
This can improve performance by reducing the amount of resources that need to be loaded and parsed on initial page load.
Image formats like WebP often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption. Convert image to WebP</li>

<li>Fonts
Ensure text remain during web font load
Best Practice
Vertically align the "+" symbol on the image grid , light-box caption, light-box close btn and the light-box next and prev btn
Add H2 to page Contact ( Message Us , Contact Us )
Fix opacity scroll to Top and added to Home page</li>

<li>Links
Remove the fake links that were in the footer
Fixed the link ( Are you ready Contact me )
Added links to the social media icons</li>

<li>Performance
Eliminated render-blocking resources reduce the impact of these render-blocking URLs by inlining critical resources, deferring non-critical resources.
Button toggle switch the three separate icons toggle by one icon this can reduce the length of code and performance of the website.</li>
</ul>
